/**
 * This is the base class to all congestion controllers. Any congestion
 * controller that is to use this NS3 component has to inherit from this
 * class. Additionally a congestion controller needs to implement virtual
 * member functions #processSendPacket , #processFeedback , #getBandwidth ,
 * and (optionally) #reset . The controller's algorithm implementation is
 * indeed the code behind these three member functions.
 *
 * As the class's name implies, the congestion control algorithm has to be
 * sender-based; this means that the congestion control algorithm will be
 * running exclusively at the sender endpoint. The receiver endpoint timestamps
 * the arrival of media packets and sends per-packet feedback back to the
 * sender endpoint.
 *
 * Even if this class has pure virtual methods and cannot therefore be directly
 * instantiated, it contains the common basic behavior we consider all
 * congestion control algorithms need:
 *
 *  - Match send and receive timestamps of a packet and calculate its one way
 *    delay (OWD)
 *  - Calculate other packet metrics the can be useful for congestion control
 *    algorithms (e.g, packet loss ratio, average loss interval)
 *
 * We intend congestion controllers derived from this class to be independent
 * from NS3 (as far as possible). The reason for this requirement is to render
 * these congestion controller implementations easier to reuse in an emulated
 * environment, or on a real testbed, rather than NS3. For this reason:
 *  - We don't follow NS3's code guidelines in these files
 *  - We define a logging callback, rather than directly using NS3 logging
 *    within the controller classes
